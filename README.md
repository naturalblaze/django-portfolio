## Description
* Django Portfolio for Blaze Bryant


## Setup Project and test server with `UV`
- Create Python Virtual Environment
```bash
uv venv
```

- Activate `venv`
```bash
source .venv/bin/activate
```

- Install requirement libraries
```bash
uv sync
```

- Initialize Django project
> :exclamation: Note the `.` at the end of the command. This will create the project files and structure directly within the current directory. You do not have to use this option but if you don't then `manage.py` will be nested in the `<project-name>` folder with another `<project-name>` folder with the project files.

```bash
django-admin startproject portfolio_project .
```

- Add the `<project-name>` folder name to your `pyproject.toml` in the `tool.setuptools.packages.find` and `tool.coverage.report` sections

- Add the `<project-name>` folder name to your `Makefile` and `make.bat` variables

- Test starting the server
```bash
python manage.py runserver
```

- Test server is running: [Django Local Server](http://127.0.0.1:8000/)
